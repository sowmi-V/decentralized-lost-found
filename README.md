#  Decentralized Lost & Found (dApp)

## Submission for WCHL25 – Golden Hour (2PM–3PM)

### Track: Open Track

### Overview:
This project is a blockchain-powered Lost & Found system, designed to help people quickly report and recover lost items at large public events (concerts, festivals, schools, etc).

### Problem:
At big events, people often lose items. Traditional Lost & Found booths are inefficient, unorganized, and sometimes dishonest.

###Solution:
A decentralized app (dApp) that lets users:
- 📝 Submit details of lost or found items
- 🔍 Search the global list of submitted items
- 🔐 Ensure entries are tamper-proof via blockchain

### Planned Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Internet Computer (ICP) Canister for data storage
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (MVP)

### Features (MVP):
- A simple form to submit lost/found item details
- A list view of all entries
- Placeholder logic for ICP integration

### Goal:
Build a transparent, accessible, on-chain lost & found system that scales with events and provides real social impact.

### Status:
Submitted during Golden Hour (2–3 PM) with MVP. Full version will be built post-submission.
